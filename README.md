This is a machine learning project that predicts whether a person has diabetes or not. The model is built using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and is coded in Python.

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a person has diabetes or not. The model is trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains information about patients who have diabetes and those who do not. The model is evaluated on a test set and achieves an accuracy of 77%.

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of 77% on the test set.

## Future Work

* Improve the model's accuracy by using different algorithms or hyperparameter tuning.
* Add a web interface for users to input their data and get a prediction.
* Deploy the model to a cloud platform.
